These supported NPs were utilized as the electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Surfactant-assisted reduction of platinum(II) acetylacetonate in hot organic solution yielded 1.2 nm Pt NPs. These ultrasmall Pt NPs were decorated on rGO, VC and the rGO-VC hybrid by using a simple liquid-phase self-assembly method. In the previous studies on Pt/rGO-VC hybrids, on one hand, Pt NPs were synthesized in situ on support, on the other hand, VC was added to synthesized Pt/rGO, and their fuel cell performance have been rarely shown. In our study, rGO and VC were directly mixed and prepared Pt NPs were assembled on rGO-VC hybrid support. Pt/rGO-VC hybrid electrocatalyst possessed substantially better electrocatalytic activity owing to better utilization of Pt compared to Pt/rGO and Pt/VC. Membrane electrode assemblies based on resultant catalysts were characterized in-situ in PEMFC. A superior PEMFC performance of 857 mW cm\\u22122 (maximum power density) was achieved with the hybrid catalyst as compared to Pt NPs supported on rGO or VC.\",\n          \"Consumers' privacy concerns remain the primary barrier for future growth of e-commerce. Research to date has so far considered privacy concerns either as an independent variable to explore consumers' actual (or stated) behavioural intentions (e.g. the decision to purchase goods online) or as dependent variable explained through a number of antecedents (e.g. privacy awareness). However, there has not been a formal link across antecedents, latent constructs and (stated) behavioural intentions. This study establishes this link through a stated choice experiment, and an integrated latent variable and choice model. The proposed approach simultaneously explains individuals' perceptions of privacy and general caution through observed individual characteristics and explores how these perceptions, in the form of latent constructs, may be associated with consumers' decisions to engage with an online transaction. The stated choice experiment is designed to collect consumers' choices across online retailers, a conventional store and an opt-out option in which online retailers are presented with varying levels of personal-information requirements. The data was collected come from over 500 respondents representing the online-user population in the UK. Model estimation results show that the higher an individual's privacy concern, general caution and technical protection, the less likely a consumer is to purchase a product online. In a joint model, the privacy concern variable is found to outweigh the effect of general caution and technical protection. Finally, consumers with higher levels of general caution are more sensitive towards an online retailer that shares their personal data with third parties.\",\n          \"Buddleja salviifolia leaves are used for the treatment of eye infections and neurodegenerative conditions in South Africa. Three phenolic compounds identified as 4'-hydroxyphenyl ethyl vanillate (1), acteoside (2) and quercetin (3) from leaf extracts of the B. salviifolia were investigated for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition and antioxidant activities using \\u03b2-carotene-linoleic acid and DPPH assays. In silico parameters were also determined for COX-2. All the compounds exhibited good inhibition activity against COX-2 and moderate antioxidant activities at a screening concentration of 25.0\\u03bcg/ml. Acteoside was the most potent in all assays. It exhibited the lowest IC50 value (4.28\\u03bcg/ml) in the COX-2 and EC50 values of 24.15 and 63.30\\u03bcg/ml in the \\u03b2-carotene-linoleic acid and DPPH assays respectively. Computational molecular docking showed its molecular interaction with important amino acid residues in the catalytic site of COX-2, revealing its potential binding mode at the molecular level. In silico study revealed that quercetin and acteoside showed the highest binding affinity (dock score of 92.18 and 68.93k.cal/mol) and good hydrogen bond interactions with active site residues.

of them increased the T-antigen levels in the cells (Fig. 2a).', 'To verify this, we switched the experimental set up and utilized the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL)-deficient renal carcinoma cells (RCC4\\u2212pVHL), where HIF-1\\u03b1 levels are always upregulated regardless of whether the cells are grown under normoxia or hypoxia (Fig. 2b) [32,33] For comparative reasons, we also used RCC4 cells with reintroduced pVHL protein (RCC4pVHL).', 'In these cells, HIF levels are up-regulated only by hypoxia.', 'Both RCC4 cells and the reconstituted RCC4pVHL cells displayed low levels of the T-antigen in normoxia (Fig. 2b).', 'In contrast, they both showed marked (3-fold) increase in PNA binding in response to 24 h hypoxia.', 'These data indicated that the observed sialylation changes are not mediated by the accumulation of HIFs, but rather, involve a HIF-independent mechanism(s).', 'Therefore, we next focused on other potential defects by which hypoxia could attenuate terminal sialylation of N- and O-glycans.', 'As our main targets, we chose N-glycan terminating ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase and its binding partner \\u03b21,4-galactosyltransferase (B4GalT-I or GalT-I) due to their co-operational functioning [23].', 'Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses (Fig. 2c) showed that 24 h hypoxia exposure did not induce marked expression level changes of these two endogenously expressed enzyme protein, nor that of GlcNAcT-I (a preceding enzyme in N-glycan synthesis), despite the fact that qRT-PCR analyses revealed a slight down-regulation of their mRNAs as well as an up-regulation of O-glycan modifying ppGalNAcT-6 mRNA together with the HIF-target gene LDHA mRNA (Fig. 2d).', 'This indicated that potential expression changes in the ST6Gal-I cannot be responsible for the loss of sialylation in hypoxic cells.', 'Z-stack imaging with a confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that hypoxia also did not alter the subcellular distribution of these three enzymes (Fig. 2e).', \\\"In each case, the Pearson's correlation coefficients were remarkably similar between normoxic and hypoxic cells, relative to the GM130 cis-Golgi marker (Fig. 2f).\\\", 'Moreover, since glycosylation is a pH-sensitive process [34] and hypoxia is known to induce a metabolic shift to glycolysis and thereby increase acid load [35,36], we also tested whether hypoxia can cause sialylation defects by altering Golgi luminal pH (Fig. 2g\\u2013i).', 'Golgi pH measurements using a ratiometric pH-sensitive probe pHluorin [37] revealed a transient pH increase at 4 h of hypoxia treatment (Fig. 2g), which, however, rapidly declined (by 8 h) and reached the original level at 24 h (pH 6.3 vs. 6.1, respectively, Fig. 2g).', 'At steady state, Golgi resting pH in hypoxic cells was not significantly lower than that of normoxic cells (Fig. 2h).', 'Finally, combined treatments of cells with hypoxia and 40 mM chloroquine (CQ, a pH gradient dissipating agent, see Ref. [26] were not cumulative, despite they both increased PNA binding by \\u223c3 fold (Fig. 2i).', 'Taken together, these data indicate that reduced sialylation of N-glycans is not associated with changes in the expression and localization of the enzymes involved, nor with changes in Golgi luminal pH.', 'Since hypoxia can potentially alter the redox state of a cell, compartment, or protein, we utilized next the ratiometric redox-sensitive fluorescent probe RoGFP2 (Fig. 3a) to examine whether hypoxia alters oxidative potential of the Golgi lumen and also that of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).', 'We found that the ratio between oxidized and reduced RoGFP2 (a measure of oxidative potential of the environment) in the Golgi in normoxic cells was higher than that of the ER (Fig. 3b), consistent with previous data [38].', 'We also noted that hypoxia caused a more significant decrease in the RoGFP2 ratio of the Golgi than in the ER (35% vs 25%).', 'This decrease was time-dependent (Fig. 3c), in accord with the increase of the T-antigen expression by hypoxia (Fig. 1c).', 'Next, to estimate the amount of reducing equivalents generated by hypoxia in the Golgi, we titrated Golgi oxidative potential with increasing concentrations of dithiothreitol (DTT).', 'DTT, even at low concentration (5 mM), can confer redox-sensitive disulfide bonds to free thiols [39].', 'Accordingly, DTT markedly decreased the RoGFP2 ratio in the cells in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 3d), 8.7 mM DTT giving an equivalent decrease in Golgi oxidative potential to that seen by moderate (5% O2) hypoxia.', 'Previous studies have shown that sequentially acting Golgi glycosyltransferases can form both homomeric and functionally more important heteromeric complexes in vivo [23].', 'Since the formation of heteromers is also sensitive to existing environmental conditions, we decided next to test whether the lowered Golgi oxidative potential could modulate their assembly in the Golgi, and thereby attenuate sialylation.', 'To accomplish this, we utilized the existing mVenus- and mCherry-tagged N- and O-glycosyltransferase constructs as FRET pairs [23].', 'Quantification of the FRET efficiencies with Operetta high content imaging system revealed that hypoxia had only minor effects on the assembly of enzyme homomers (Fig. EV2a,b).', 'In contrast, hypoxia repressed significantly the assembly of ST6Gal-I/B4GalT-I and ST3Gal-III/B4GalT-I enzyme heteromers (Fig. 4a), enzyme heteromers while having no effect on the assembly of the medial-Golgi GlcNAcT-I/GlcNAcT-II heteromers.', 'Hypoxia also markedly suppressed the assembly of ppGalNAcT-6/C1GalT-I, ppGalNAcT-6/C2GNT-1 (also termed GCNT1) and ppGalNAcT-6/C3GNT-1 (B3GNT6) O-glycosyltransferase heteromers (Fig. 4b).', 'This repression was evident already after 4 h exposure to moderate hypoxia (Fig. 4c).', 'With time, this repression became more prominent and reached 80% inhibition by 24 h of hypoxia treatment (Fig. 4c).', 'Again, no decrease in the formation of homomers (B4GalT-I, also termed GalT-I) was observed.', 'To confirm whether this repression is due to reduced oxidative potential of the Golgi lumen in hypoxic cells, we treated cells with 3\\u201310 mM DTT for up to 24 h in normoxic conditions (Fig. 4d).', 'Similar to hypoxia exposure, this treatment inhibited the assembly of B4GalT-I/ST6Gal-I and B4GalT-I/ST3Gal-III heteromers, without affecting markedly the assembly of B4GalT-I homomers (Fig. 4d) or the subcellular localization of ST6Gal-I (Fig EV3).', 'Taken together, these data show that the hypoxia-induced Golgi redox state change results in the loss of functionally important heteromeric complexes between B4GalT-I and ST6Gal-I and also between B4GalT-I and ST3Gal-III.', 'Next, we investigated the possibility that the lowered Golgi oxidative potential in hypoxic cells may inhibit disulfide bond formation either in the ER or the Golgi compartment using the ST6Gal-I/B4GalT-I pair as a target.', 'The main reasons behind this was their verified catalytic domain interactions [24], the availability of validated antibodies and their published crystal structures [40,41].', 'Of these two enzymes, ST6Gal-I harbors nine distinct cysteine residues [42], six of which reside in the catalytic domain.', 'Two of these (C184, C335) form one internal disulfide bond that likely is important for the overall structural fold of the catalytic domain.', 'The rest four cysteines form two distinct surface exposed disulfide bonds (Fig. 5a).', 'To test whether any one(s) of these are affected by hypoxia, we stained cells overexpressing both ST6Gal-I and B4GalT-I in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions with BODIPY\\u00ae FL-conjugated maleimide (a thiol-specific labeling reagent).', 'Quantification of the bound fluorescent dye to either enzyme protein in immunoprecipitated samples after separation with Blue-Native (BN)-PAGE (Fig. 5b) revealed that hypoxia increased labeling of the ST6Gal-I band by 3-fold without affecting labeling of the B4GalT-I.', 'This increase corresponds to the presence of four additional thiol groups in ST6Gal-I protein, given that the enzyme normally has two thiol groups in its transmembrane (TM) domain [42], but together with four additional ones in the catalytic domain (CD), they will give a ratio of 3 (6/2) between normoxic and hypoxic samples.', 'This value is very close to the 2.92 (\\u00b10.61) fold increase obtained experimentally in dye binding to STT6Gal-I protein in hypoxic cells (Fig. 5b).', 'Therefore, it is likely that hypoxia causes the loss of two disulfide bonds in the catalytic domain of ST6Gal-I protein.', 'To reveal which one(s) of the disulfide bonds are affected by hypoxia, we replaced one cysteine in each disulfide bond with serine or alanine residue before testing whether the mutants still localize correctly in the Golgi membranes and can form ST6Gal-I homomers and heteromers with B4GalT-I.', 'We found that only the C184A mutant mislocalized into the ER, likely due to improper folding of the mutant enzyme (Fig. 5c).', 'This is in line with this cysteine forming an internal disulfide bond important for the ST6Gal-I catalytic domain structure (Fig. 5a).', 'All the other single mutants (C24S, C353A, C406A) localized correctly in the Golgi membranes, indicating their proper folding and transport to the organelle.', 'They also did not drastically inhibit the assembly of ST6Gal-I homomers (Fig. 5d), nor the assembly of B4GalT-I/ST6Gal-I heteromers (Fig. 5e).', 'However, the double cysteine mutant (C353A, C406A; termed CysDM) in which the two cysteines forming different disulfide bonds were mutated at the same time showed markedly reduced ability (80% inhibition, Fig. 5e) to interact with B4GalT-I without affecting the assembly of CysDM homomers (Fig. 5d).', 'Thus, the CysDM mutant behaves similarly to the wild type enzyme in hypoxia, suggesting that the two disulfide bonds normally present are critical for the functional assembly of the B4GalT-I/ST6Gal-I heteromers, but not for the assembly of ST6Gal-I homomers.', 'The observed loss of ST6Gal-I heteromers therefore can be responsible for attenuated sialylation of N-linked glycans in hypoxic cells.', 'To find out whether the loss of the two disulfide bonds (between C353/C364 and C142/C406) has any effect on the enzymatic activity of the ST6Gal, we measured first its ability to add \\u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid to cell surface glycans in normoxic cells.', 'The wild type ST6Gal-I (STT6Gal-IWT) was used as a control.', 'We expressed both these enzyme constructs individually in the cells for 24 h and determined a-2,6-linked sialic acid content by staining cells with Alexa 488-conjugated SNA lectin and quantifying the bound dye with Operetta high content imaging system.', 'We found that expression of wild type ST6Gal-I increased SNA lectin binding to cells by two-fold, when compared to non-transfected cells (Fig. 5f).', 'However, no such increase was detected with the CysDM, suggesting that this double mutant is enzymatically inactive.', 'We verified this by determining sialyltransferase activity for both the wild type ST6Gal-I and the CysDM.', 'The C353A single cysteine mutant was also included, as this cysteine residue seems to be part of the active site.', 'Cell lysates prepared from cells expressing the ST6Gal-IWT showed roughly 7-fold increase in sialyltransferase activity compared to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5g).', 'In contrast, the activity of the single mutant (C353A) was only 2-fold higher than that of mock-transfected control cells, while the CysDM showed barely no activity at all.', 'These data demonstrate that the two surface exposed disulfide bonds in ST6Gal-I are not only needed for heteromer assembly (Fig. 5e), but also for its catalytic activity.', 'Structure comparisons of the known sialyltransferase crystal structures [41,43\\u201345] indicated further that the two surface exposed disulfide bonds are conserved among the members of the sialyltransferase gene family.', 'For example, the structure of the rat ST6Gal-I catalytic domain (Fig. 6a) displays identical disulfide bonds to those present in the human enzyme (Fig. 5a).', 'Likewise, the pig ST3Gal-I (Fig. 5b) sialyltransferase (also known as SIAT4A), which is implicated in mucin type O-glycan, glycosaminoglycan and glycolipid biosynthesis, shows similarly two such surface exposed disulfide bonds, albeit in a different configuration, suggesting their conservation in other sialyltransferases as well.', 'Their presence and likely sensitivity hypoxia is supported by the reduced sialylation of O-glycans in hypoxic cells (Fig. 1a).', 'In contrast, the human ST8Sia-III \\u03b12,8-sialyltransferase (Fig. 6c) and human ST6GalNAc-II (Fig. 6d) display only one such surface exposed disulfide bond and may behave differently from the former two.', 'Whether the ST3Gal-III, a sialyltransferase that terminates N-glycans with \\u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid behaves similarly to the ST6Gal-I remains unclear until its crystal structure becomes available.', 'Without detailed structural information, it is difficult reliably to predict which cysteine residues in the primary structure will be disulfide-bonded with each other.', 'This is due to the high sequence variability even between functionally similar enzymes.', 'Previous studies have indicated a correlation between ST6Gal-I activity and cancer metastasis, while in others such correlation has not been found [46].', 'There are also other studies, showing that ST6Gal-I overexpression changes cellular phenotype or behavior, e.g. by increasing proliferation, migration, radiation resistance, invasion and metastasis [47\\u201350].', 'Therefore, it was important to address what functional consequences, if any, inactivation of ST6Gal-I has in the cells.', 'To address this, we transfected cells with either an empty vector, wild type ST6Gal-I (ST6Gal-IWT) or the CysDM encoding plasmids, and followed possible changes in proliferation, migration and apoptotic resistance as well as changes in nuclear or cell morphology.', 'We found that overexpression of the ST6Gal-IWT, but not that of CysDM (Fig. 7a), increased \\u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid level in the cells (Fig. 7b and c), as expected.', 'This increase had a negative impact on cell proliferation (Fig. 7d) and migration in a wound healing assay, while the CysDM had no effect (Fig. 7e and f).', \\\"None of them, however, altered markedly cells' apoptosis resistance (Fig. 7g), the size of the nuclear area and its roundness (Fig. 7h and i), or cell morphological properties (cytoplasmic area and roundness, Fig. 7j and k).\\\", 'Thus, in contrast to cancers, increased sialylation by overexpressed ST6Gal-I in non-malignant COS-7 cells is inhibitory to cell proliferation and migratory behavior.', 'Therefore, it is likely that inactivation of ST6Gal-I by hypoxia serves for better cell survival by enhancing their proliferative and migratory behavior of hypoxic cells.', 'The data described above provides a direct mechanistic link between hypoxia, attenuated sialylation of N- and O-glycans, lowered Golgi (and ER) oxidative potential, reduced disulfide bond formation and the loss of catalytic activity of a relevant ST6Gal-I N-sialyltransferase and its ability to interact with its binding partner B4GalT-I.', 'Thereby, hypoxia-induced silencing of the ST6Gal-I provides also a rational explanation for the attenuated sialylation of N-glycans in hypoxic cells.', 'Intriguingly, its binding partner B4GalT-I appears not to be affected, consistent with increased levels of terminal galactoses in N-glycans.', 'Similar surface exposed disulfide bonds are also present in ST3Gal-I sialyltransferase, an enzyme implicated in the synthesis of O-glycans, glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids.', 'This suggests that other glycosylation pathways are also defective in hypoxic cells.', 'Our findings also show that glycosylation can be, to a large extent, independent of the HIF system, and emphasizes the sensitivity of the glycosylation process to changing oxygen concentrations.', 'Since the HIF system involves HIF-dependent transcription, followed by translation of a certain protein, i.e. represents a long-term response towards hypoxia, the involvement of a redox switch regulating directly glycosylation enzymes themselves indicates a short-term response.', 'Hence, this system allows an immediate response towards hypoxia that helps cells to proliferate due to their altered glycosylation profiles.', 'The data unveils a hitherto unknown regulatory circuit that relies on disulfide bond formation in the Golgi and is needed normally for the catalytic activation of ST6Gal-I in this cellular compartment.', 'In support of this view, we showed that the loss of the two surface exposed disulfide bonds seen in hypoxic cells or obtained by mutagenesis of the selected cysteine residues in ST6Gal-I resulted in the loss of enzymatic activity and its ability to interact with GalT-I.', 'The two surface-exposed disulfide bonds in ST6Gal-I are thus needed not only for the catalytic activity but also to facilitate ST6Gal-I/B4GalT-I complex assembly, a phenomenon that likely involves a subtle conformational change in ST6Gal-I and is mediated by the formation of the two disulfide bonds.', 'The fact that the assembly of the complex takes place only after the enzymes arrive in the Golgi compartment [23], indicates that the two surface-exposed disulfide bonds must also form in this compartment.', 'In accordance with this view, the oxidative potential was reduced by hypoxia to the same level it is in the ER in normoxic cells.', 'The higher oxidative potential of the Golgi lumen, therefore, would provide proper conditions for disulfide bond formation in the Golgi and likely serves as a means to prevent premature sialylation of various acceptor glycans by keeping the enzyme inactive until it reaches the slightly acidic and more oxidative environment in the Golgi lumen.', 'Finally, similar redox state-sensitive disulfide bonds are known to exist in other proteins including occludin, whose homotypic interactions and motility in the membrane are similarly affected by hypoxia [51].', 'The formation of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers from vWF oligomers takes place in the Golgi compartments and involves tail-to-tail interactions via disulfide bonds [52].', 'This molecular circuitry involving hypoxia-sensitive disulfide bond formation in the Golgi apparatus, therefore represents a new level of regulation of glycosylation and shows that enzymes can be activated post-translationally in a compartment they normally function in the cell.', 'Sialylation regulates numerous cellular processes, including cell\\u2013cell communication, immune surveillance, defense against pathogens and cancer progression and metastasis [46,53].', 'In cancers, especially \\u03b1-2,6-sialylation is increased and correlates with increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis, while inhibiting apoptosis [47\\u201350].', 'In contrast, we found that overexpression of the wild type ST6Gal-I, but not that of the inactive cysteine mutant, slowed down cell proliferation and migration, while having no effect on staurosporine-induced apoptosis and cell or nuclear morphology.', 'Therefore, the inactive ST6Gal-I in hypoxic cells likely helps cells to survive and adapt to low oxygen levels.', 'This discrepant behavior between cancer cells and cells expressing inactive ST6Gal-I likely reflects the lack of truncated O-linked glycans in our experimental system, as cancer cells and also hypoxic cells (this study) display tumorigenesis promoting truncated O-linked glycans [21,54].', 'Nevertheless, the fact that increased \\u03b1-2,6-sialylation slowed down cell proliferation and migration suggests that inactivation of ST6Gal-I has an important role in allowing non-malignant cells to adapt to low oxygen environment.', 'It is also of notice that the ST6Gal-I almost certainly is not the only enzyme that is sensitive to hypoxia, as our structure comparisons revealed similar surface exposed disulfide bonds in ST3Gal-I, an enzyme implicated in the synthesis of O-linked glycans, keratan sulfate and glycolipids.', 'Our findings, however, do not explain why hypoxia alters Golgi redox homeostasis.', 'The main obstacle preventing this is that only few proteins with clear regulatory role in setting up the high oxidative potential in the Golgi lumen are known.', 'One of them is the Golgi-localized QSOX1a protein that has been shown to play a role in disulfide bond formation, possibly in the maturation of ECM components and the formation of higher order structures there [55].', 'Two other proteins, glutaredoxins Grx6 and Grx7, which are closely related with each other and likely are part of the redox state regulatory system in the Golgi, belong to the glutaredoxin family of proteins that normally catalyze the reduction of disulfide bonds in their substrate proteins.', 'They both localize in the cis-Golgi in S. cerevisiae [56] and show high glutaredoxin activity.', 'Yeast knockout cells also display growth defects and sensitivity toward oxidizing agents, indicating their important roles in the maintenance of Golgi redox homeostasis.', 'However, Grx6 and Grx7 do not seem to have a general role in the oxidative protein folding, but rather, in counteracting the oxidation of specific thiol groups in substrate proteins [56].', 'These findings thus imply that the redox pair discovered in the Golgi may represent another compartment-specific redox pair.', 'Similar redox switches are well known to exist in the cytosol, plasma membrane, nucleus and the extra-cellular space, where the thioredoxin1/Txnip (thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2)/vitamin D3 upregulated protein (VDUP1)) plays an important role.', 'Another similar system may account for redox homeostasis in mitochondria, where the Trx2/Txnip complex is enriched under conditions of oxidative stress [57].', 'Further work, therefore, is needed to identify the molecular machinery responsible for the unique redox state and high oxidative potential of the Golgi compartments.', 'A.H., F.K-A., E.K., E.Y.D., D.M., D. H. and M.N performed research and analyzed the data, A.H-L.', 'designed the sialyltransferase enzymatic assays, supervised the work of M.N and compiled the activity data.', 'T.G. supervised the structural studies of.', 'D.B.

(2015), and Sovacool and Ratan (2012).', 'In these cases, factors were not the starting point, but instead the outcome of a theory-based data analysis.', 'The theories served as analytical frameworks and explanation models to varying degrees.', 'Factors were later discussed and compared with findings from other studies.', 'From our point of view, the openness related to factors provides the advantage of a direct relation to a specific case.', 'Additionally, compared to previously fixed factors, all aspects mentioned by interviewees during data collection can be considered in the analysis phase.', 'These strong, qualitatively oriented research methods are suitable for explorative studies in which not all factors are already known.', 'Generally, the factors vary between cases.', 'Thus, a simple adoption of factors to other cases bears the risk of disconnecting the empirical work from theory and excluding important acceptance factors.', 'The question that arises is whether common/universal and transferable factors exist.', 'Schenk et al. (2007) state that regardless of the acceptance object, there are some similar factors, but no evidence exists for the most important ones, \\u201cespecially in the context of nature and landscape conservation measures\\u201d (Schenk et al., 2007, pp. 67).', 'Indeed, after analysing the body of literature, some similar factors are apparent.', 'For example, trust, participation, knowledge, prior experiences, and economic and visual aspects are frequently cited as influencing factors.', 'However, researchers\\u00b4 opinions and scientific evidence regarding the most important factors strongly depend on the theoretical foundations of each study.4', 'Furthermore, factors in form-driving forces are rarely clearly defined entities across the range of studies and are per se not on the same level.', 'More general or unspecific factors often encompass a bundle of specific factors (economical aspects, justice, communication, perceived (dis)advantages, general attitude, etc.).', 'Due to their lack of specificity, these general factors are often used.', 'However, factors can also be of a specific character describing a narrow issue, a particular situation, or specific circumstances (e.g., production costs, job creation, perceived procedural justice, prior experiences, or attitudes towards technology or towards the innovation initiator).', 'In conclusion, creating a complete list of all factors and determining which are most crucial seems to require a disproportionate amount of effort and is likely to be less useful.', 'In this literature review, we sought to synthesise publications\\u2019 contributions to the acceptance phenomena in order to advance the theoretical-conceptual debate on this topic.', 'Therefore, we discussed its epistemological foundations and linkages and analytically revealed its weaknesses.', 'In summary, the lack of definitions and theories of acceptance and acceptability as well as an insufficient theoretical foundation regarding the selection of explanatory factors are widespread among studies.', 'Many consider acceptance only as a positive outcome that should be achieved when planning projects (e.g., Specht et al., 2016).', 'Few publications acknowledge the complexity of these issues and the need for a theoretical-conceptual foundation (e.g., Fournis and Fortin, 2017).', 'Based on the analysed literature, we conclude with our own reflections in order to advance the scientific understanding of the conceptualization of acceptance.', 'To prevent misunderstandings related to the use of terms (as outlined above) and to thereby achieve more clarity, we advocate differentiating between acceptance and acceptability, as suggested by Fournis and Fortin (2017).', 'This enables the recognition of acceptability as complex scientific concept and the simultaneous recognition of acceptance as positive outcome of a judgement processes and everyday term.', 'To conclude for this review, this differentiation means that most analysed studies deal with acceptability rather than with acceptance.5', 'According to our understanding, acceptability encompasses: (a) actor-based and dynamic decision processes that are supported by value-based arguments and formed in intrapersonal and intersubjective judgement processes.', 'These decisions, so-called acceptability decisions, are (b) the products of the interactions among the acceptability actor, the specific acceptability object, other actors, and the context.', 'Furthermore, the (c) acceptability decisions can be assigned to a particular degree (from opposition and rejection to high acceptance and engagement) and can be made on a certain level, including (d) attitude, action, or utilization.', 'At the non-proactive level of attitudes, the subject offers an internal judgement before acting.', 'At the next level, the subject alters his judgement into an action that is the expression of his attitudes.', 'The utilization level refers to assessing the long-term use of an innovation.', 'This definition of acceptability is based on theoretical reflexions from Fournis and Fortin (2017), Lucke (1995), and Wolsink (2012, 2010).', 'Applying this understanding of acceptability offers the possibility of decoding and structuring very different (regarding issues and spatial scales) cases while considering the main characteristics and elements of acceptability.', 'Furthermore, it supports an open, case-oriented, and explorative analysis in which not all drivers and influencing factors are already known.', 'In summary, we believe that land use and social research can benefit from this advanced understanding of acceptability.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

These infrastructures need to provide continuity to address long-term change, yet be flexible enough to respond to rapid societal and technological developments that modify research priorities. We used a horizon scanning exercise to identify and prioritize emerging research questions for the future development of ecosystem and socio-ecological research infrastructures in Europe. Twenty research questions covered topics related to (i) ecosystem structures and processes, (ii) the impacts of anthropogenic drivers on ecosystems, (iii) ecosystem services and socio-ecological systems and (iv), methods and research infrastructures. Several key priorities for the development of research infrastructures emerged. Addressing complex environmental issues requires the adoption of a whole-system approach, achieved through integration of biotic, abiotic and socio-economic measurements. Interoperability among different research infrastructures needs to be improved by developing standard measurements, harmonizing methods, and establishing capacities and tools for data integration, processing, storage and analysis. Future research infrastructures should support a range of methodological approaches including observation, experiments and modelling. They should also have flexibility to respond to new requirements, for example by adjusting the spatio-temporal design of measurements. When new methods are introduced, compatibility with important long-term data series must be ensured. Finally, indicators, tools, and transdisciplinary approaches to identify, quantify and value ecosystem services across spatial scales and domains need to be advanced.\",\n          \"How bacteriophages impact bacterial communities in vivo is unclear. Hsu et al. investigate this in mice carrying a model microbiome. Phage predation directly impacts susceptible bacteria, leading to cascading effects on other bacterial species, with consequences on the gut metabolome. Phages can be harnessed to modulate the microbiome and host.\",\n          \"The sequential search strategy is a prominent model of searcher behavior, derived as a rule by which females might sample and choose a mate from a distribution of prospective partners. The strategy involves a threshold criterion against which prospective mates are evaluated. The optimal threshold depends on the attributes of prospective mates, which are likely to vary across generations or within the lifetime of searchers due to stochastic environmental events. The extent of this variability and the cost to acquire information on the distribution of the quality of prospective mates determine whether a learned or environmentally canalized threshold is likely to be favored. In this paper, we determine conditions on cross-generational perturbations of the distribution of male phenotypes that allow for the evolutionary stability of an environmentally canalized threshold. In particular, we derive conditions under which there is a genetically determined threshold that is optimal over an evolutionary time scale in comparison to any other unlearned threshold. These considerations also reveal a simple algorithm by which the threshold could be learned.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subjareas\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 165,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['ENER', 'ENGI', 'MATE']\",\n          \"['ENGI', 'ENVI', 'MEDI', 'SOCI']\",\n          \"['BIOC', 'CENG', 'IMMU', 'PHAR']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3553,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Adaptive fa\\u00e7ade', 'Building performance simulation', 'Predictive control', 'Responsive building envelope', 'Smart glazing']\",\n          \"['Beach mega-nourishment', 'Coastal evolution model', 'Coastal resilience', 'Dungeness', 'Shoreline evolution', 'Shoreline management planning']\",\n          \"['DNA methylation', 'Early life experiences', 'Epigenetics', 'Human behavior', 'Oxytocin receptor gene']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"asjc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 745,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['1303', '1307', '1309', '1311']\",\n          \"['1203', '3310']\",\n          \"['2738', '2803']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"body_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4009,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Long, tubular mouthparts have evolved multiple times convergently in various nectar and blood-feeding insect taxa (Krenn et al., 2005;

an extremely long proboscis.', 'This is especially evident in the distal section of the food canal, which is formed by a single component, making this proboscid structure special amongst insects.',

adaption towards different plant species within various families displaying different tube lengths that are present across the habitat (Forest et al., 2014).', \\\"Both contrasting models for the evolution of exceptionally long nectar spurs in plants, i.e. Darwin's coevolutionary race and the pollinator shift hypothesis may explain the evolution of exceptionally long-spurred flowers (Goldblatt and Manning, 2006; Whittall and Hodges, 2007).\\\", 'However, these models do not completely explain the evolution of exceptionally long proboscides in some flower-visiting insects.', 'Regarded from the pollinators perspective, the diffuse co-evolution model (Johnson and Steiner, 1997; Johnson and Anderson, 2010) might be a more realistic scenario when applied to the studies that have investigated the morphological adaptation in long-proboscid flies (Karolyi et al., 2013).', 'Similarly shaped flowers interact with certain representatives of Nemestrinidae and Tabanidae with similar proboscis lengths.', 'The convergent evolution of exceptionally long proboscides in these insects might be triggered by the dominant community of plants in a habitat.', 'Assuming that these flies are unable to switch to other nectar sources, the spur lengths of available flowers represent the natural selective force that is responsible for the convergent evolution of exceptionally long-proboscid flies.', 'The second precondition is that the involved insects possess the potential of elongating a rather simple structure of the mouthparts in a way that benefits of an elongated proboscis balance the anatomical costs of obtaining such lengths.', 'This is seen in nemestrinid flies and now here in tabanid flies where only the distal parts of the proboscis - that is formed by a single unit - are adapted to the nectar spur length.', 'However, the positive scaling relationships between proboscid length and suction pump muscle size, as seen in both long-proboscid Nemestrinidae (Karolyi et al., 2013) and Tabanidae, indicates that obtaining an elongated proboscid requires some cost through reciprocal anatomical modifications.', 'Karolyi et al. (2013) showed the behavioural cost related to increased feeding time with an elongated proboscis; however, how having an elongated proboscis effects overall fly morphology (muscle mass, wing length, etc.) and body size, and ultimately the evolution and speciation of long-proboscid flies is unknown.', 'Both males and females from the genus Philoliche use their elongated mouthparts to draw nectar from long-spurred flowers.', 'In contrast, blood feeding females only use the relatively short piercing mouthparts (Goodier, 1962;

Mitter, 1918; Goodier, 1962; Dierl, 1968).', 'In order to maintain a pressure drop in the extraordinarily long food canal, both the proximal and distal food canal require adequate sealing structures (Karolyi et al., 2012).', 'In Philoliche, the labrum forms the dorsal cover of the piercing structures and contains the epipharyngeal food canal.', 'Similar to the labral retractor of short-proboscid Tabanidae (Bonhag, 1951), labral muscles insert within the labral base via tendon-like fibres in Philoliche.', 'Contracting this muscle possibly presses the labrum against the mandible blades and the hypopharynx, sealing the food canal dorsally.', 'The unpaired clypeolabral muscle could be regarded as an ancestral character state for Diptera (Schneeberg and Beutel, 2011).', 'In addition, the proximal food canal is ventrally sealed by the overlapping mandible blades, while the distal food canal is sealed by the interlocking lateral walls of the prementum, forming a dorsal tongue and groove joint.', 'This results in a concealed, straw-like nectar extracting apparatus, which leads to the pseudotracheal system of the labella.', 'There, nectar is taken up and then transported through the elongated premental food canal into the head via the main sucking pump (Karolyi et al., 2012).', 'As in Prosoeca, the labella of Philoliche were remarkably short, heavily sclerotised and sclerites required for movement, as well as the labella musculature were reduced.', 'However, limited movability of the labella might represent a particular adaptation for nectar uptake from narrow, elongated flower tubes.', 'Such flower traits prevent the labella from spreading apart, and nectar intake is therefore performed with closed labella (Karolyi et al., 2012).', 'During blood-feeding, the initial laceration of the host skin is achieved by scissor like movement of the apical serrated mandible blades (Bonhag, 1951;

a proof-of-concept study to test if masking the carboxylic acid of VA by esterification (Fig. 1) would affect the in vivo activity of VA.', 'Four VA-esters with different lipophilicity (LogP: VA

Figs. 3\\u20135) and was directly confirmed by estimation of the plasma concentrations of VA (Table 1).', 'In order to obtain information about potential differences in the time courses of anxiolytic activity of esters, behavior was analyzed 15, 30, 60 min after treatment.', 'As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, methylation and propylation of VA resulted in a faster onset of anxiolysis, while VA-EE and VA-POM displayed no activity after 15 min.', 'All esters were almost equally active after 30 min with the exception of the VA-POM that did not cause significant anxiolysis (Fig. 3B).', 'A longer lasting anxiolytic action of VA-ME and VA-EE is evident from Fig. 3C where both compounds were at 60 min significantly more active than VA.', 'These alterations may depend on different factors including distinct distribution of the prodrug into organs dependent on its lipophilicity.', 'This may also include alterations of binding to plasma proteins or fatty tissue.', 'A second important factor is the conversion of the non-active prodrug into the active VA by esterases.', 'The anticonvulsant activity of VA and the ester derivatives was observed for the first time.', 'Significant differences in onset and length of the anticonvulsant action of the VA-esters are evident from Fig. 5.', 'VA (dotted line in Fig. 5A\\u2013D) displayed little activity after 15 min, reached maximal anticonvulsant activity after 30 min that decayed until 90 min.', 'A comparable transient time course of action was observed for the propylester (VA-PE) displaying, however, significantly stronger effects at 30 min.', 'An exceptional result was obtained with the ethylester of VA: remarkably, VA-EE displayed no significant anticonvulsant activity at early time points (15 and 30 min, Fig. 5B).', 'However, a long-lasting anticonvulsant action of this compound until 120 min is evident from Fig. 5B.', 'The anticonvulsant action of VA-POM was similarly delayed but not so long lasting as VA-EE (compare Fig. 5B and D).', 'The late anticonvulsant effects of VA-EE (Fig. 5B) are in line with its pronounced anxiolytic effect after 60 min (Fig. 3C).', 'In contrast, VA-ME displayed highest anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities at the earliest time-point (15 min).', 'The most lipophilic VA-POM displayed the least anxiolytic or anticonvulsant activity compared to the most polar VA.', 'This might relate to two possible explanations: either the ethylester is stronger bond to proteins or lipophilic surfaces, leading to a slower but longer distribution, or the ethylester is less accessible for esterases, leading to an increased stability of this potential prodrug.', 'The first reason appears unlikely, because the lipophilicity of the ethylester is comparable to those of the methyl- and propylesters, which both display faster onset of effects.', 'Of note is the fact, that the most lipophilic ester (VA-POM) displayed comparatively little in vivo activity, suggesting that this compound might be trapped in lipophilic structures.', 'Hydrolysis of VA-esters in plasma was confirmed employing an LC\\u2013MS/MS assay as already described (Sampath et al., 2012).', 'Plasma levels after i.p. application of any of the VA-esters after 15 min were lower than after application of VA despite the stronger in vivo activity (Figs. 3\\u20135).', 'Tissue binding and delayed hydrolysis of VA-esters by esterases might contribute to the lower plasma levels of VA.', 'However, in vivo VA-esters were similarly or even more active than VA (VA-ME, VA-EE, VA-PE) (see Figs. 3\\u20135) which may indicate a rapid penetration of these potential prodrugs into brain.', 'Based on their lipophilicity it cannot be excluded that parent VA-esters may reach significant brain concentration.', 'Although esterification of VA strongly reduces IGABA modulation in vitro (Fig. 2) their potentially better penetration of the blood\\u2013brain barrier may contribute to the overall anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activity.', 'The much slower onset and longer lasting anticonvulsant activity of VA-EE and VA-POM may reflect a slower hydrolysis in the brain (see Fig. 5B and D).', 'Ongoing animal studies shall therefore verify time- and dose-dependent penetration of VA-esters into brain.', 'Taken together, several VA-esters display similar or stronger in vivo activity than VA.', 'The different time courses of anticonvulsant activity (e.g. fast onset of the VA-ME and long lasting effects of the VA-EE) may be beneficial for potential therapeutic use of this molecule.', 'Future studies will show whether the increased lipophilicity of the esters will affect the oral bioavailability of VA.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

Several reports of reduced risk of adverse outcomes associated with influenza vaccination have generated interest in its potential for improving pregnancy outcome. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, estimates maternal influenza immunization programs in low-income countries would have a relatively modest impact on mortality compared to other new or under-utilized vaccines, however the impact would be substantially greater if reported vaccine effects on improved pregnancy outcomes were accurate. Here, we examine the available evidence and methodological issues bearing on the relationship between influenza vaccination and pregnancy outcome, particularly preterm birth and fetal growth restriction, and summarize research needs. Evidence for absence of harm associated with vaccination at a point in time is not symmetric with evidence of benefit, given the scenario in which vaccination reduces risk of influenza disease and, in turn, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. The empirical evidence for vaccination preventing influenza in pregnant women is strong, but the evidence that influenza itself causes adverse pregnancy outcomes is inconsistent and limited in quality. Studies of vaccination and pregnancy outcome have produced mixed evidence of potential benefit but are limited in terms of influenza disease assessment and control of confounding, and their analytic methods often fail to fully address the longitudinal nature of pregnancy and influenza prevalence. We recommend making full use of results of randomized trials, re-analysis of existing observational studies to account for confounding and time-related factors, and quantitative assessment of the potential benefits of vaccination in improving pregnancy outcome, all of which should be informed by the collective engagement of experts in influenza, vaccines, and perinatal health.\",\n          \"This data article contains complementary figure and movies (Supplementary Movies 1-3) related to the research article entitled, \\\"Effective synaptome analysis of itch-mediating neurons in the spinal cord: a novel immunohistochemical methodology using high-voltage electron microscopy\\\" [7]. It is important to show the synaptic connections at the ultrastructural level to understand the neural circuit, which requires the three-dimensional (3-D) analyses in the electron microscopy. Here, we applied a new sample preparation method, a high-contrast en bloc staining according to the protocol of the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (NCMIR), University of California, San Diego, CA, USA to high-voltage electron microscopy (HVEM) tomography in order to examine the 3-D chemical neuroanatomy of the rat spinal cord. Pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy was used in this study. HVEM has an excellent potential to directly visualize the ultrastructures in semi-thin sections (~5. \\u03bcm thick), and we have successfully visualized many itch-mediating synaptic connections and neural networks in the spinal cord using \\\"HVEM tomography\\\". Moreover, the methodology used in this study is simple and can be applied in multiple ways. This is an important contribution to ultrastructural investigations of the central nervous system in the present post-genomic age.\",\n          \"Soil organic carbon (SOC) was re-analysed 10 years after application of source-segregated green waste compost at a 1 ha previously-developed UK site to compare with the increases suggested by the 4 per mille initiative proposed at COP21 in Paris. Compost prepared to PAS100 standard had been incorporated once at rates of 250, 500 and 750 t\\u00b7ha\\u22121 in 2007 in clay subsoil prior to planting of perennial energy crops. Our results show statistically significant differential increases in SOC, total nutrients N and P, or contaminants Zn, Pb, Cu, As and B, remain from the compost application after a decade. For the 500 or 750 t\\u00b7ha\\u22121 compost rates the SOC increments in the upper 10\\u201315 cm were 0.85% or 1.6% over the 4.9% developed from a baseline of 1.8% in control areas by a decade of natural regeneration. Calculation of the elemental loadings from the compost analyses compared to the present-day levels suggests SOC declines after application at an average annual rate approaching 10%, compared to 5% for the nutrients or contaminants, roughly equivalent to half-lives of 5 or 10 years respectively. The study demonstrates the long-term soil organic matter (SOM) additions, fertility benefits and technical feasibility of a one-off, high-rate application of waste-derived compost to improve urban soils, compared to the potential trade-off of adding to PTE loadings. This longevity of SOC addition, previously unrecognised in brownfield soils, may be inferred for other areas where further cultivation is precluded, as is typical after landscape restoration or under perennial energy crops for the production of biomass.

understand and translating into practice, it is an inadequate definition for FGR.', 'FGR can be a consequence of maternal, fetal, or placental factors.', 'Diagnosing all fetuses with an estimated fetal weight (EFW) below the tenth percentile with FGR fails to account for the individual growth potential of each fetus.', 'Constitutionally small fetuses who might be expected to have a lower birthweight based on parental characteristics may be misdiagnosed as pathologically small [15].', 'Conversely, fetuses destined for a higher birthweight may fail to reach their growth potential due to a pathologic process yet never fall below a threshold based on fetal or birth weight below a specific centile (e.g. 10th) [16].', 'An ideal definition of FGR would detect those fetuses with a pathologic failure to meet their growth potential subsequently at risk of adverse outcomes.', 'Numerous studies have attempted to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the definition through adjunct testing and optimization of growth curves used to define the tenth percentile diagnostic cutoff.', 'The sentinel investigations into FGR used measurements of the fetal head, abdomen, and femur to develop growth curves within small homogenous patient populations [17].', 'Though these measurements yielded reliable estimations of fetal weight, the growth curves lacked generalizability, particularly in an international context [18].', 'Contemporary studies on FGR have advocated individualized growth curves accounting for maternal and fetal characteristics such as ethnicity and gender to solve this dilemma [19\\u201321].', 'However, large-scale international prospective studies of healthy pregnancies show little difference in growth curves between populations [22].', 'Additional studies investigating the utility of adjunct studies such as amniotic fluid assessment and use of Doppler attempt to further clarify the definition of FGR [23,24].', 'Despite these controversies in defining FGR, its detection is an important component of antenatal care.', 'The majority of the prior vaccine studies in pregnant women, including specifically those focused on obstetric outcomes, do not address FGR as an adverse outcome [25\\u201328].', 'Some authors have reported neonatal outcomes including identification of low birth weight (LBW) and SGA infants without an attempt to detect these events in pregnancy [29\\u201331].', 'Though neonatal disorders of growth potential could be considered a postnatal diagnosis of FGR, they are different diagnoses with distinct implications within the context of studies on immunizations.', 'The likely cause of pathologic FGR can vary in according to clinical setting.', 'Some etiologies of FGR, such as preeclampsia or congenital anomalies, may be similar across clinical settings.', 'FGR associated with maternal comorbidity such as advanced maternal age or gastric bypass surgery can be considered unique to countries with higher healthcare related expenditures [32,33].', 'In contrast FGR in lower income countries is more likely to be associated with malnutrition or parasitic diseases, with malaria being the classic

is necessary to identify a temporal relationship between the diagnosis of FGR and a vaccine of interest.', 'There is a paucity of data on FGR in existing vaccine trials, perhaps in part due to the controversy surrounding the diagnosis within the medical community.', 'Given the clinical variation in the definition, the absence of a uniformly accepted definition of FGR following immunizations is not surprising.', 'This is, however, a missed opportunity, as data comparability across trials or surveillance systems would facilitate data interpretation and promote the scientific understanding of the event.', 'Following the process described in the overview paper as well as on the Brighton Collaboration Website http://www.brightoncollaboration.org/internet/en/index/process.html, the Brighton Collaboration Fetal Growth Restriction Working Group was formed in 2015 and included members from clinical, academic, public health, and industry backgrounds [47].', 'The composition of the working and reference group as well as results of the web-based survey completed by the reference group with subsequent discussions in the working group can be viewed at: http://www.brightoncollaboration.org/internet/en/index/working_groups.html.', 'To guide the decision-making for the case definition and guidelines, a literature search was performed using Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Libraries, including the terms [fetal (Fetal) growth restriction or retardation], [intrauterine growth restriction or retardation] and [small for gestational age].', 'The search resulted in the identification of 23,441 English-language references, 5480 of which were published within the past five years.', 'All abstracts were screened for relevance to a contemporary definition of FGR in a singleton pregnancy with particular attention to those related to infection, immunization, and under-represented countries.', '102 articles with potentially relevant material were reviewed in more detail, in order to identify studies using case definitions or, in their absence, providing clinical descriptions of the case material.', 'The literature search revealed extensive literature on the definition of FGR and development of associated growth curves and adjunct testing.', 'No immuzation-related studies contained definitions of FGR and this outcome was seldom discussed.', 'The most commonly encountered definitions were in medical society statements and contained substantial variation in both terminology and definitions.', 'Similar heterogeneity was found in the definition of FGR throughout scientific studies addressing outcomes and management of this pregnancy complication.', 'An inventory comprising the 102 relevant articles along with society definitions of FGR was made available to working group members via the Collections feature of MyNCBI.', 'Terms such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and small for gestational age (SGA) are often used in clinical practice interchangeably with FGR.', 'The term SGA has been proposed by some groups, including the Brighton Collaborative, as a diagnosis limited to neonates [11,48].', 'Other society guidelines suggest using IUGR to identify those fetuses at risk of pathologic growth restriction and limiting the use of SGA to reference a constitutionally small fetus without evidence of pathology [12\\u201314,49].', 'In order to distinguish between a neonatal and fetal diagnosis of disorders of growth, use of the term SGA to reference a fetal disorder of growth will be avoided.', 'IUGR and FGR are used interchangeably with less confusion as both clearly reference a diagnosis of growth restriction established prior to delivery.', 'To limit confusion between these variably defined terms the Brighton definitions will utilize the term fetal growth restriction to define this adverse advent with levels of diagnostic certainty to further describe concern for pathologic FGR.', 'The number of sonographic findings that will be documented for each case may vary considerably depending on availability of technology in a given setting and availability of additional clinical information, such as pregnancy dating, critical to establishing a diagnosis.', 'The case definition has been formulated such that the Level 1 definition is highly specific for the condition.', 'As maximum specificity normally implies a loss of sensitivity, an additional diagnostic level has been included in the definition, offering a stepwise increase of sensitivity from Level 1 to Level 2, while retaining an acceptable level of specificity at all levels.', 'Each Level has been further subdivided into subcategories of A and B in an attempt to better define pathologic FGR.', 'Within both Levels, a subgroup of A provides better specificity and certainty for a pathologic process.', 'Level B may be more sensitive for FGR but includes less specific findings with less certainty for its pathology.', 'In this way it is hoped that all possible cases of FGR can be captured with clarity as to the concern for a disorder of fetal growth potential.', 'It needs to be emphasized that the grading of definition levels is entirely about diagnostic certainty, not clinical severity of an event.', 'Thus, a clinically very severe event may appropriately be classified as Level Two rather than Level One if it could reasonably be of non-FGR etiology (e.g. in cases of limited evidence of pregnancy dating).', 'Detailed information about the severity of the event should additionally always be recorded, as specified by the data collection guidelines.', 'FGR is most often diagnosed by use of ultrasound.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus and placenta shows potential for furthering understanding of pathophysiology.', 'However, this technology is time-consuming, expensive, and primarily restricted to research settings limiting its use for inclusion in the Brighton definition of FGR.', 'At the other end of the spectrum, exam findings such as symphysis fundal height measurements are clinically ubiquitous for the detection of FGR [50].', 'This clinical measurement lacks sensitivity, offers little insight into potential for pathology, and lacks evidence for routine use limiting its utility in a research setting [51].', 'Additional studies such as placental pathologic examination, placental biomarkers, and related clinical diagnoses may offer insight into the underlying pathophysiology for FGR [52,53].', 'This adjunct testing offers clinical utility for screening for and further understanding of FGR but lends little to establishing the initial diagnosis.', 'Therefore, the Brighton case definition of FGR will focus on use of a combination of B-mode and Doppler ultrasound technology to establish the diagnosis of FGR.', 'This approach should allow for adequate sensitivity and specificity without making identification of the adverse event overly cumbersome for investigators in study settings with limited resources.', 'Ultrasound may not be universally available in all clinical settings, but its presence is requisite for diagnosis of FGR as an adverse event within the context of vaccine trials.', 'In settings where ultrasound is unavailable for an antenatal diagnosis of disorders of fetal growth, investigators may use the Brighton Definition for Small for Gestational Age neonates as an alternative [48].', 'The most basic definition of FGR includes a fetus with a sonographic estimation of fetal weight below the tenth percentile for a given gestational age with increasing specificity for adverse perinatal outcomes below the third percentile [24].', 'A variety of fetal biometric measurements and functional Doppler studies have been studied to optimize the detection of FGR.', 'Biometric parameters typically involve an assessment of head size (e.g. biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), occipitofrontal diameter (OFD)), abdominal size (e.g. abdominal circumference (AC) or abdominal diameter (AD)), and femur length [54,55].', 'A comprehensive guide to the technical performance of these measurements and other sonographic technique is beyond the scope of this paper, but several key points must be emphasized.', 'Healthcare providers performing obstetric ultrasound should be trained in proper technique with assessment of quality to ensure inter- and intra-rater reliability.', 'Selected sonographic studies should follow international published standards for obtaining and reporting measurements with appropriate references to resources used during scientific publication.', 'As previously described, the choice of a specific growth curve and its associated characteristics is a subject of ongoing debate in the obstetric community based on wide variation between published reference curves [18].', 'Many publically available growth curves currently available in ultrasound machines were derived from small homogenous populations [17].', 'Customized growth curves incorporating maternal and fetal characteristics have shown improved specificity over population-based curves in individual studies yet fail to demonstrate superiority in the most recent meta-analyses [19,21,56].', 'Contemporary population-based growth curves derived from a diverse population of low-risk pregnancies such as those from the INTERGROWTH-21st package show little variation in fetal size across non-isolated populations [22,57,58].', 'Yet translation of these growth standards into clinical practice is ongoing with presumably limited access to this data in existing technology [59].', 'The majority of existing society guidelines either lack recommendations on specific growth curve use or suggest employing a customized curve [12,14,49].', 'However, all of these guidelines were developed before the recent publication of newer fetal growth standards and expert opinion varies [10,60,61].', 'Resolving the ongoing debate of the ideal growth curve selection is beyond the scope of this project.', 'Furthermore, prescribing a specific standard may unduly restrict participation of study sites with limited resources to access additional growth curves.', 'Though the Brighton definition of FGR does not include a single specific growth curve, several key features of a selected growth curve should be emphasized.', 'Study sites in any given trial should select a single curve to allow for meaningful comparison between sites.', 'Selected growth curves should be internationally validated using a large sample size and published as a peer-reviewed study with an available reference.', 'An optimal curve would be based on pregnancies with reliable early pregnancy dating, prospective data collection, and validation of measurements to avoid intra-observer bias.', 'In addition to a sonographic estimation of fetal weight, additional techniques can be used to aid in the diagnosis of FGR.', 'As with the acquisition of measurements, adherence to existing performance standards should be ensured when performing this adjunctive testing [62].', 'These additional studies can include an assessment of amniotic fluid volume and Doppler velocities through varying maternal, placental, and fetal vessels where technology allows.', 'Amongst the variety of Doppler studies available, assessment of velocities in the umbilical artery is one of the most accessible both in terms of technical ease and interpretation.', 'Absence or reversal of diastolic velocities in the umbilical artery has been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes that are rare in the setting of normal umbilical artery velocities [63].', 'Inclusion of umbilical artery Doppler waveforms in the definition allows for added certainty in the diagnosis of pathologic growth restriction with minimal additional time or skill.', 'Doppler studies of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), ductus venosus, uterine arteries and the relationships between these values (e.g. the cerebral placental ratio (CPR)) have also been employed in the clinical description and prediction of FGR.', 'Contemporary expert consensus guidelines attempting to better characterize early-onset and late-onset FGR underscore the clinical utility of measurements such as the CPR and the umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) in assessment of FGR [60].', 'The PI is calculated using the peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, and time averaged velocity in a given artery and comparing this value to existing standards for a given gestational age.', 'An umbilical artery PI above the 95%ile has been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes similar to absent or reversed diastolic frequencies but with lower incidence [24].', 'This clinically useful measurement would likely improve the specificity of pathologic growth restriction, but has a slightly greater technical requirement with a need for further interpretation using a normative standard.', 'The working group balanced specificity for FGR with establishing a case definition that can be achieved across a wide range of clinical settings with varying access to equipment and operator training.', 'For this reason, pulsatility indices were not included in the case definition of FGR.', 'Similar reasoning guided the exclusion of CPR in the group\\u2019s definition of FGR.', 'The CPR is derived by comparing the PI in the umbilical artery to that in the MCA and has a similar role in predicting adverse outcomes likely due to its role in detecting brain-sparing growth restriction [64,65].', 'Brain-sparing growth restriction in which a fetus redirects blood flow away from the viscera in favor of the brain is associated with poorer perinatal outcomes [66].', 'Aside from an abnormal CPR, this subset of FGR is suggested by an abdominal circumference lagging the estimated weight of the fetus [24].', 'An isolated abdominal circumference below the tenth percentile can be associated with adverse outcomes and has been utilized in recent consensus guidelines to define pathology [24,60].', 'Reference standards for this individual measurement have similar variation and challenges to those involving estimated fetal weight and rely on a single measurement to define pathology [18].', 'Though assessment for brain-sparing using these techniques would add specificity to the pathologic FGR diagnosis, it would involve significant additional technical requirements as well as increase the risk of false positives due to technical error.', 'Based on this information and the absence of recommendation for routine use in existing clinical guidelines use of Doppler other than velocimetry in the umbilical artery are not included in the case definition for FGR [23,24].', 'Assessment of amniotic fluid volume is a routine component of prenatal ultrasound and diagnosis with varying definitions of oligohydramnios in the literature.', 'Potential etiologies for oligohydramnios are diverse and this finding is less specific than Doppler velocities in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes [24].', 'In the absence of evidence of rupture of membranes or fetal anomalies contributing to the pathology, oligohydramnios is often interpreted as a marker for placental insufficiency and therefore pathology.', 'Though an estimated fetal weight below the tenth percentile in association with oligohydramnios does not predict adverse outcomes, it does suggest pathologic FGR more so than an isolated finding of a small fetus.', 'Therefore, in an attempt to improve the sensitivity of the case definition for FGR oligohydramnios has been included in the definition realizing it may decrease specificity.', 'Additional sensitivity in the definition could be achieved by tracking an individual fetus\\u2019s growth over time.', 'Serial ultrasound would improve sensitivity for FGR through identification of fetuses failing to reach their growth potential but not falling below the tenth percentile.', 'The improvement in sensitivity would come at a tradeoff for additional ultrasound scans which may be overly cumbersome in the context of a vaccine trial.', 'In the interest of feasibility these criteria were not included in the case definition.', 'The current case definition balances sensitivity and specificity of the definition of FGR.', 'However great care was taken to consider the feasibility of the definition within the context of a vaccine trial with the potential for study sites with varying access to healthcare resources and technology.', 'Access to basic B-mode ultrasound is requisite for the diagnosis at any level of certainty, with a requirement for basic Doppler capabilities for the highest level of diagnostic certainty.', 'In an attempt to make a Level One diagnosis of FGR accessible, after thoughtful consideration more complex criteria that could improve the sensitivity or specificity of detection of disorders of fetal growth potential were excluded.', 'Specific time frames for onset of symptoms following immunization are not included in the definition of FGR.', 'There is a paucity of data about relationship between immunization and FGR with no evidence on which to base recommendations on a temporal relationship.', 'We postulate that a definition designed to be a suitable tool for testing causal relationships requires ascertainment of the outcome (e.g. FGR) independent from the exposure (e.g. immunizations).', 'Therefore, to avoid selection bias, a restrictive time interval from immunization to onset of FGR should not be an integral part of such a definition.', 'Instead, where feasible, details of this interval should be assessed and reported as described in the data collection guidelines.', 'Further, FGR often occurs outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial or hospital.', 'When possible, a sonographic assessment of fetal weight before vaccination could aid in the evaluation of FGR prior to vaccine administration.', 'In cases where FGR can be identified prior to vaccine administration exclusion of these pregnancies from the trial can be considered.', 'Given the increase in adverse events in pregnancies affected by FGR this strategy may avoid an overestimation of associations between the vaccine and an adverse outcome.', 'In some settings it may be impossible to screen for FGR or obtain a clear timeline of the event, particularly in less developed or rural settings.', 'In order to avoid selecting against such cases, the Brighton Collaboration case definition avoids setting requirements for FGR screening and arbitrary time frames.', 'As mentioned in the overview paper, the case definition is accompanied by guidelines which are structured according to the steps of conducting a clinical trial, i.e. data collection, analysis and presentation.', 'Neither case definition nor guidelines are intended to guide or establish criteria for management of ill infants, children, or adults.', 'Both were developed to improve data comparability.', 'Similar to all Brighton Collaboration case definitions and

temperature), which is similar to results from studies using traditional detection methods that found decreased rearing densities of several salmonids around the same temperature range (Frissell, 1992).', 'While our results are somewhat confounded by the increased rate of DNA degradation that occurs at higher temperatures, this may suggest a potential use of eDNA detection methods to help determine habitat preference or confirm habitat suitability across large habitats.', 'The molecular assay used in this study was designed to detect the presence of Chinook salmon at the species level.', 'To better understand distributions of spring versus summer Chinook within a subbasin, without relying on spatial and temporal assumptions, an assay capable of accurately differentiating between the two life-history types, perhaps targeting single-nucleotide polymorphisms in additional regions of the Chinook genome, would be a necessary and valuable tool.', 'Salmonid distributions can be determined using the molecular methods described in this study.', 'While we admittedly did not control for stream discharge, concentrations of genetic material do appear to be localized, or limited, in terms of their ability to be transferred and accumulated downstream by flowing water.', 'These localized concentrations of Chinook eDNA may be caused by spatial variation in fish densities.', 'Further research should focus on identifying limiting factors of eDNA transport and persistence and modeling local fish densities across large landscapes using eDNA analysis.', 'This study can help inform the development of monitoring programs using eDNA to determine the distribution of salmonids in large watersheds.', 'For the purpose of population monitoring, this method is not necessarily intended to replace traditional survey methods such as electrofishing or snorkel count surveys (especially where count data or actual, rather than relative, density is required) but could be a valuable, complementary tool to rapidly determine distributions and assess and prioritize stream reaches to better assign limited resources.']\",\n          \"['Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow

These supported NPs were utilized as the electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Surfactant-assisted reduction of platinum(II) acetylacetonate in hot organic solution yielded 1.2 nm Pt NPs. These ultrasmall Pt NPs were decorated on rGO, VC and the rGO-VC hybrid by using a simple liquid-phase self-assembly method. In the previous studies on Pt/rGO-VC hybrids, on one hand, Pt NPs were synthesized in situ on support, on the other hand, VC was added to synthesized Pt/rGO, and their fuel cell performance have been rarely shown. In our study, rGO and VC were directly mixed and prepared Pt NPs were assembled on rGO-VC hybrid support. Pt/rGO-VC hybrid electrocatalyst possessed substantially better electrocatalytic activity owing to better utilization of Pt compared to Pt/rGO and Pt/VC. Membrane electrode assemblies based on resultant catalysts were characterized in-situ in PEMFC. A superior PEMFC performance of 857 mW cm\\u22122 (maximum power density) was achieved with the hybrid catalyst as compared to Pt NPs supported on rGO or VC.\",\n          \"Consumers' privacy concerns remain the primary barrier for future growth of e-commerce. Research to date has so far considered privacy concerns either as an independent variable to explore consumers' actual (or stated) behavioural intentions (e.g. the decision to purchase goods online) or as dependent variable explained through a number of antecedents (e.g. privacy awareness). However, there has not been a formal link across antecedents, latent constructs and (stated) behavioural intentions. This study establishes this link through a stated choice experiment, and an integrated latent variable and choice model. The proposed approach simultaneously explains individuals' perceptions of privacy and general caution through observed individual characteristics and explores how these perceptions, in the form of latent constructs, may be associated with consumers' decisions to engage with an online transaction. The stated choice experiment is designed to collect consumers' choices across online retailers, a conventional store and an opt-out option in which online retailers are presented with varying levels of personal-information requirements. The data was collected come from over 500 respondents representing the online-user population in the UK. Model estimation results show that the higher an individual's privacy concern, general caution and technical protection, the less likely a consumer is to purchase a product online. In a joint model, the privacy concern variable is found to outweigh the effect of general caution and technical protection. Finally, consumers with higher levels of general caution are more sensitive towards an online retailer that shares their personal data with third parties.\",\n          \"Buddleja salviifolia leaves are used for the treatment of eye infections and neurodegenerative conditions in South Africa. Three phenolic compounds identified as 4'-hydroxyphenyl ethyl vanillate (1), acteoside (2) and quercetin (3) from leaf extracts of the B. salviifolia were investigated for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition and antioxidant activities using \\u03b2-carotene-linoleic acid and DPPH assays. In silico parameters were also determined for COX-2. All the compounds exhibited good inhibition activity against COX-2 and moderate antioxidant activities at a screening concentration of 25.0\\u03bcg/ml. Acteoside was the most potent in all assays. It exhibited the lowest IC50 value (4.28\\u03bcg/ml) in the COX-2 and EC50 values of 24.15 and 63.30\\u03bcg/ml in the \\u03b2-carotene-linoleic acid and DPPH assays respectively. Computational molecular docking showed its molecular interaction with important amino acid residues in the catalytic site of COX-2, revealing its potential binding mode at the molecular level. In silico study revealed that quercetin and acteoside showed the highest binding affinity (dock score of 92.18 and 68.93k.cal/mol) and good hydrogen bond interactions with active site residues. The activities demonstrated by these compounds (1-3) suggest that they could be useful in management of inflammatory conditions. \\u00a9 2014 South African Association of Botanists.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subjareas\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"asjc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"body_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author_highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"important_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Data Segmentation and Preparation: We divide the text data into segments of abstracts, titles, and body texts and prepare them by trimming each to specific word limits to ensure conciseness and relevance. We initially divide each document into an abstract (limited to 200 words), a title (capped at 50 words), and body text (250 words). Additionally, we enrich this segment by identifying and including the top 10 keywords from the body text using BERT-based topic modeling. We then extended the body text to two more segments by adding an additional 500 words each segment to deepen the analysis.\n",

Topic Modeling: We used a BERT-based topic modeling technique on the body text to distill topics that encapsulate the corpus's semantic content, aiding in dimensionality reduction and contextual understanding.

The multimodality treatments for this tumor including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, are still not completely satisfied. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), one member of the isothiocyanate family, has been shown to induce apoptosis in many human cancer cells. In this study, we investigate the pro-apoptotic effects caused by PETIC in human brain glioblastoma multiforme GBM 8401 cells. In our data, PEITC induced the cell morphological changes and decreased the cell viability of GBM8401 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, the analysis of cell cycle distribution detected by flow cytometry showed that PEITC induced significantly sub-G1 phase (apoptotic population) in GBM 8401 cells. In addition, PEITC promoted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase in [Ca2+]I, but decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in treated cells. PEITC also induced caspases activities in GBM 8401 cells. Results from Western blot analysis indicated that PEITC promoted Fas, FasL, FADD, TRAIL, caspase-8, -9, -3, increased the pro-apoptotic protein (Bax, Bid and Bak), and inhibited the anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) in GBM 8401 cells.

Their chemical synthesis presents several challenges in establishing at least two chiral centres. Here a de novo metabolic pathway using a transketolase enzyme coupled with a transaminase enzyme has been assembled. To synthesise this motif one of the strategies to obtain high conversions from the transaminase/transketolase cascade is the use of hydroxypyruvate (HPA) as a two-carbon donor for the transketolase reaction; although commercially available it is relatively expensive limiting application of the pathway on an industrial scale. Alternately, HPA can be synthesised but this introduces a further synthetic step. In this study two different biocatalytic strategies were developed for the synthesis of (2S,3R)-2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT) without adding HPA into the reaction. Firstly, a sequential cascade of three enzymatic steps (two transaminases and one transketolase) for the synthesis of ABT from serine, pyruvate and glycolaldehyde as substrates. Secondly, a two-step recycling cascade where serine is used as donor to aminate erythrulose (catalysed by a transketolase) for the simultaneous synthesis of ABT and HPA. In order to test the novel pathways, three new transaminases are described, two ω-transaminases able to accept a broad range of amine acceptors with serine [SEP] ['Chiral amino alcohols are key functionalities in several sphingolipids, antibiotics such as chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol, and antiviral glycosidase inhibitors such as the deoxynojirimycin family among others [1].', 'These compounds can be synthesized by either chemical or biocatalytic methods.', 'Among the various chemical methods available, diastereoisometric crystallisation [2] and asymmetric hydrogenation [3] have been established.', 'However, the low maximum yield (up to 50%) and the pre-activation of the substrate as well as the high price of the transition metal and recycling/disposal, respectively, are their main disadvantages [2].', 'Biocatalysis on the other hand allows the development of sustainable manufacturing processes and the production of highly enantiopure compounds in high yields due to the enzymes chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity [4].', 'Monoamine oxidases, lyases, transaminases [2] and the recently described imine reductases [5,6] and norcoclaurine synthase [7] have been implemented in the synthesis of chiral amino alcohols.', 'Among them, transaminases are industrially desirable as they have broad substrate specificity and high levels of regio- and stereoselectivity, in spite of their unfavourable equilibrium and substrate and/or product inhibition [8–10].', 'They have been successfully used at an industrial scale replacing chemical synthesis, e.g., in sitagliptin manufacture.', 'Sitagliptin is an antidiabetic compound, which has been chemically synthesised by rhodium-catalysed asymmetric enamine hydrogenation at 250 psi.', 'Following various rounds of substrate walking and directed evolution, an ω-transaminase was engineered and successfully employed in the synthesis of sitagliptin at higher yields and productivity, and lower waste compared to the chemical method [11].', 'Another example is for the synthesis of [SEP] Multi-step biocatalytic strategies for chiral amino alcohol synthesis [SEP] 1h hz mhz mmol nmr 2h ch3 cdcl3 reaction 3h\", \"step biotransformations, transaminases have been coupled to additional enzymatic steps broadening the scope of the chemicals produced from inexpensive substrates.', 'For instance, the synthesis of l-norephedrine was performed by coupling an R-selective pyruvate decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [13] or an acetohydroxyacid synthase I from Escherichia coli [14] with an ω-transaminase.', 'In the first step benzaldehyde and pyruvate were used as substrates for the production of l-phenylacetylcarbinol, which was then aminated by the transaminase synthesising l-norephedrine.', 'The latter step used alanine as amine donor releasing pyruvate as co-product, which was further employed as a substrate for the first reaction generating a recycling mechanism able to shift the equilibrium of the cascade [13,14].', 'In our group we have been studying de novo pathways coupling a transketolase enzyme with a transaminase enzyme.', 'In an early study, a one-pot in vivo approach was performed for the production of 2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT), using glycolaldehyde (GA) and β-hydroxypyruvate (HPA) as substrates for the transketolase step, followed by transamination of the erythrulose product with S-(α)-methylbenzylamine (MBA) as amine donor, employing a transaminase from Pseudomonas putida.', 'In spite of the successful synthesis of the amino alcohol using E. coli as whole cell biocatalyst, the resulting yield (∼21% mol/mol) was low due to a long reaction time for the transaminase step, possibly because of its low affinity towards the substrates, or side reactions consuming erythrulose [15].', 'Following the description of the CV2025 transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum [16], this enzyme was implemented in the above transketolase/transaminase pathway, and with the replacement of MBA with isopropylamine (IPA) as amine donor, a 4-fold increase in the percentage of conversion (from 21% to 87%) for the synthesis of ABT was achieved [17].', 'In both studies, the reaction was performed in resting cells without any host optimisation, requiring the supply of all substrates involved, namely MBA or IPA, GA and HPA.', 'Both MBA and IPA are non-natural compounds; HPA is available within the cell in the phosphorylated form; and GA is found in the biosynthetic pathway of folic acid (in pentose and glucuronate interconversions) and vitamin B6, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism [18].', 'Therefore, to perform de novo pathway integration, both amine donor and keto donor for the transaminase and transketolase reactions would have to be provided by either an additional enzymatic step or an alternative donor than the ones previously employed.', 'In this work, we have in vitro studied different strategies to supply non-phosphorylated HPA to the previously described enzymatic pathway, as well as the possibilities of using alternative amine donors for the transaminase step.', 'The first system (Fig. 1) involved the addition of a serine transaminase that can produce HPA by the amination of pyruvate using serine as amine donor followed by the previously described cascade [15,17], generating a three step pathway.', 'The second reaction system (Fig. 2) corresponds to a two-step recycling system of the co-product.', 'Thus by aminating erythrulose with serine, ABT and HPA could be synthesised simultaneously, the latter can be further consumed during the transketolase reaction recycling this substrate (HPA)\", \"in a two-step pathway.', 'The conversion of HPA by transketolase and the release of CO2 in the reaction should effectively drive the enzyme pathway to the formation of ABT.', 'To achieve the synthesis of ABT as a case study using the proposed alternative pathways, three new transaminases were identified and characterised in terms of their kinetic parameters and amine acceptor profile.', 'The best candidates were tested in vitro as possible biocatalysts of the novel cascades described in this work.', 'Strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1.', 'Each of the transaminase genes, described in Table 1, was amplified by PCR implementing the primers illustrated in Table 2.', 'PCR products were incorporated into pCR4-TOPO (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer recommendations.', 'Before transferring the gene to pET29a+ (Novagen, USA) expression vector, each sequence was confirmed by gene sequencing performed by the Wolfson Institute at UCL.', 'pQR plasmids were finally constructed by ligating the plasmid pET29a+, previously restricted with NdeI and XhoI (New England BioLabs, UK), with the corresponding fragment obtained from the restriction of pCR4-TOPO::PCR with the same restriction enzymes.', 'Glycerol stocks of all cultures were stored at −80 °C in 2xYT broth (16 g/l tryptone, 10 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l NaCl) containing 20% glycerol.', 'Overnight cultures were prepared in 2xYT broth supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.', 'Cells were subcultured using 1% v/v inoculum in 2 l shake flasks containing 500 ml of the same supplemented broth at 37 °C and 250 rpm.', 'Transaminases were induced with 1 mM of IPTG when growing in early exponential phase (OD600 = 0.7), and temperature was dropped to 30 °C until harvesting.', 'Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 5 h of induction, and stored at −20 °C.', '15 min before harvesting pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) was added to the cells expressing the transaminases at a final concentration of 400 μM to improve enzyme activity.', 'The cell pellet after induction was resuspended in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH: 8.0 and 400 μM PLP at a 1:25 volume ratio (1 ml of the resuspension buffer per 25 ml of cell suspension);

We aim to determine the prevalence of parathyroid dysfunction in patients with \\u03b2-TM. Methods: Diagnosed cases of transfusion dependent \\u03b2-TM between 5 and 17 years of age were recruited from outpatient clinics of a non-profit organization in Karachi, Pakistan. Blood and urine samples were collected in fasting to determine Ca, P, Alb, Mg, Cr 25OHD and iPTH. Patients were grouped on the basis of upper and lower levels of Ca, 25OHD and iPTH for assessing parathyroid dysfunction into primary hypoparathyroidism [low calcium (Ca) & intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH)], sub-clinical hypoparathyroidism [low iPTH and 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD), low/normal Ca], normal functioning parathyroid gland [Normal Ca, iPTH and 25OHD] and secondary hyperparathyroidism [high iPTH, low/normal Ca and/or 25OHD]. Using PTH nomogram subject specific expected PTH (maxPTH) was calculated. Difference between maxPTH and measured iPTH was determined to assess the utility of nomogram in identifying parathyroid gland dysfunction. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Results: Median age of patients was 11 years (13\\u20137) with males being 54.2% (n = 205). Based on Ca, 25OHD and iPTH, primary hypoparathyroidism was identified in 3.4% (n = 13) [median iPTH 11.3 pg/ml (12.6\\u20137)], 52.3% (n = 192) had subclinical hypoparathyroidism [iPTH 40.4 pg/ml (52.7\\u201328.7)], and 34% (n = 125) were identified as secondary hyperparathyroidism [iPTH 88.6 pg/ml (116\\u201374.7)]. Normal response to Ca & 25OHD was seen in 10.6% (n = 39) [iPTH 44.2 pg/ml (53.8\\u201333.4)] patients. High phosphorous was present in all groups. Difference between maxPTH & iPTH was highest in primary hypoparathyroidism, followed by subclinical and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Conclusion: Nomogram by Harvey et al. identify low secretion capacity of parathyroid gland that correlated with biochemical classification of patients.

(2019) [1]. The necessary data were collected in order to be able to estimate a demand model for the different modes of transport between cities in the Northeast Corridor (NEC) of the United States. The data set includes the number of passengers, transport prices, its share within the budget of consumer expenses, for each one of the relevant passenger transportation modes: train, aeroplane, car and coach. The lack of official statistics on the number of passengers and road transport prices is confronted by reconstructing the series from the NEC freeway traffic meters. Such series shall, therefore allow us to estimate a multi-equational demand model in which the conditions of the rational consumer may be added and tested. Without this knowledge, it would not be possible to understand the elasticities and consider the most suitable maximising business strategies and public policies for the wellbeing of consumers.\",\n          \"Background: The efficacy of multivitamin/multimineral (MVM) supplementation continues to provoke considerable debate. The purpose of this study was to determine if MVM supplementation affects indices of nutrition status, antioxidant status and cardiovascular health in healthy individuals. Methods: 23 subjects (10 female, 13 male) were enrolled in a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Fasting blood samples were collected and analyzed at baseline and at study completion (i.e., final). Results: Comparison of baseline and final values indicated that placebo treatment had no significant effect, whereas MVM treatment significantly (p < 0.05) increased (mean% \\u00b1 SEM) circulating levels of vitamin B6 (518 \\u00b1 54%), B12 (71 \\u00b1 8%), E (31 \\u00b1 7%) and K (414 \\u00b1 167%). Vitamin D was significantly increased in the MVM (46 \\u00b1 9%) and placebo (13 \\u00b1 6%) group.

an intake above classical deficiency levels, yet low enough that it may increase the risk for various diseases (Holick et al., 2011).', 'Formally, vitamin D insufficiency is defined as circulating 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <75 nmol/L (Holick et al., 2011), a definition not without controversy given that the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the (legislative) body that sets the DRI\\u2019s for all essential vitamins and minerals, stipulates that circulating 25(OH)D) levels >50 nmol/L more than meets the needs of almost all people (Medicine, 2006).', 'Much of the debate surrounding this issue stems from the fact that the IOM has based its definition of sufficiency (i.e., >50 nmol/L) largely on research concerning bone health, whereas others consider evidence surrounding the effects of vitamin D on non-skeletal physiological function (Bischoff-Ferrari, Giovannucci, Willett, Dietrich, & Dawson-Hughes, 2006).', 'For example, circulating 25(OH)D) levels of 75\\u2013100 nmol/L have been associated with reduced risks for some cancers (Bouillon, Moody, Sporn, Barrett, & Norman, 2005), vascular disease (Tomson et al., 2013) and all-cause mortality (Melamed, Michos, Post, & Astor, 2008).', 'Notably, most people cannot attain this level of vitamin D in the absence of vitamin D supplementation, particularly during the winter months.', 'In this study, circulating vitamin D levels rose from 64.6 \\u00b1 11.9 to 92.4 \\u00b1 14.2 nmol/L among participants in treatment group who were receiving 2000 IU/d, a dose deemed to be safe and consistent with the range of 600\\u20134000 IU/d considered necessary to raise circulating vitamin D above 75 nmol/L in most people (Vieth, Kimball, Hu, & Walfish, 2004).', 'Vitamin E status (i.e., alpha-tocopherol) increased more than 40% (i.e., from 21.8 \\u00b1 7.6 \\u03bcmol/L to 31.2 \\u00b1 9.0 \\u03bcmol/L) in the treatment group consuming 200 IU/d (~133 mg), and remained unchanged in the placebo subjects (i.e., baseline = 24.8 \\u00b1 5.2 vs final = 23.4 \\u00b1 4.0 \\u03bcmol/L).', 'Notably, the current DRI of 15 mg/d alpha-tocopherol was established on the basis that it would be sufficient to maintain circulating levels at 14 \\u03bcmol/L, a level deemed optimal to protect red blood cells (RBC\\u2019s) from hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell lysis in vitro (Medicine, 2006).', 'As such, it is clear that on average, the baseline vitamin E status of subjects in both the treatment and control groups were adequate.', 'Indeed, only one subject was found to have a baseline vitamin E level of <14 \\u03bcmol/L.', 'However, debate surrounds the derivation of adequate vitamin E status (i.e., RBC fragility), an issue acknowledged even by the IOM (Medicine, 2006) and, consequently, debate regarding the most appropriate dietary intake and functionality of vitamin E abounds as well.', 'For example, several large RCT clinical studies indicate that vitamin E supplementation (400 IU/d) does not protect against or lower the risk for cardiovascular disease or cancer, disease states linked to oxidative stress and for which vitamin E, an antioxidant, is hypothesized to protect against (Lee et al., 2005).', 'These and other similar findings have led to an overwhelming consensus that vitamin E supplementation offers no benefit as a therapeutic agent against cancer or cardiovascular disease (Abner, Schmitt, Mendiondo, Marcum, & Kryscio, 2011).', 'However, vitamin E supplementation may benefit other aspects of human health.', 'For example, vitamin E supplementation at 200 IU/d improves numerous indices of immune function, including innate immune function and T-cell mediated immunity, each of which may lessen the risk of respiratory tract infection mediated, for example, by the influenza virus and streptococcus pneumonia (De la Fuente, Hernanz, Guayerbas, Victor, & Arnalich, 2008).', 'Several large cohort studies indicate that vitamin E is positively associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (Engelhart et al., 2002; Li, Shen, & Ji, 2012) and that vitamin E supplementation at 800\\u20132000 IU/d may slow AD progression and its attendant cognitive decline (Dysken et al., 2014; Sano et al., 1997).', 'And finally, vitamin E supplementation (800\\u20131000 IU/d) has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and histological abnormalities in the liver associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Sanyal et al., 2010).', 'Although obscure, NAFLD is a disease for which there is currently no established treatment and is estimated to affect 1 in 3 adults in the United States, with similar rates of prevalence reported in many other countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea and Columbia (Tomic, Kemp, & Roberts, 2018).', 'Taken together, these data indicate that supplemental levels of vitamin E do mediate significant health benefits, and at doses significantly higher than currently recommended by the IOM.', 'Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly elevated with MVM supplementation in the present study.', 'SOD is one of the body\\u2019s most important endogenous anti-oxidant defense mechanisms to reduce oxidative stress, and excessive oxidative stress has been implicated in a host of disease states.', 'In humans, increased circulating levels of SOD (i.e., via supplementation of melon-derived SOD) were found to reduce risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease in at-risk individuals, including reductions in lipid peroxidation and decreased carotid intima media thickness (Romao, 2015).', 'Mechanistically, the mode of action by which MVM supplementation increased SOD activity in the current study is unknown.', 'However, given that the SOD gene contains the Nrf2-antioxidant response element, and given that components of the MVM used in this study, including vitamin E, epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin and resveratrol (Milani, Ambrosi, Gammoh, Blandini, & Cereda, 2013) can activate Nrf2 signaling pathways, we can speculate that one or more of these compounds may have activated SOD expression and activity through an Nrf2-mediated mechanism.', 'We also observed a significant effect of MVM supplementation on HDL cholesterol levels.', 'Indeed, a significant increase in HDL cholesterol levels (i.e., +101 \\u00b1 148 \\u03bcmol/L, p = 0.006) in a previous open-label study of this supplement (unpublished results) provided an impetus for the current study.', 'Although the effects of MVM supplementation on HDL were attenuated in this study compared to our previous investigation, they are nevertheless significant findings.', 'HDL appears to play a prominent role in the manifestation of cardiac disease.', 'More specifically, data from epidemiological studies clearly demonstrates that there is an inverse correlation between HDL levels and the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) (Gordon, Castelli, Hjortland, Kannel, & Dawber, 1977).', 'Various mechanisms have been proposed that may account for the protective effects of HDL, including anti-inflammatory as well as antioxidant mechanisms, however the role of HDL in reverse-cholesterol transport (i.e., the transport of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver for disposal) is considered the primary determinant of HDL\\u2019s cardioprotective effects (Khera et al., 2011).', 'Irrespective of the specific mechanism, mathematical modeling indicates that each 0.025-point (in mmol/L) increase in circulating HDL levels corresponds to a 3% and 2% reduced risk in CAD in women and men, respectively (Gordon et al., 1989).', 'In this study we observed a 0.04 mmol/L increase in HDL in the MVM group, and an adjusted mean difference of 0.106 mmol/L between MVM and placebo, suggesting that this intervention could have a clinically significant beneficial effect on the risk for CAD among supplement users.', 'There are several limitations of this study.', 'First, the subjects in this study were young, relatively healthy individuals.', 'As such, the applicably of this work to other populations, particularly older individuals for whom the risk of disease and low nutritional status is increased, is open to debate.', 'Nevertheless, evidence that this particular dietary supplementation regimen raises circulating nutrient levels within normal ranges among healthy individuals suggests that similar results can be expected among individuals with a compromised nutritional status and further, that the risk of nutrient overload is negligible.', 'Second, this was a small study (n = 23 subjects) of short duration (4 weeks).', 'Studies of this design may give rise to imprecise measures of an effect, which may explain the atypical observation in this study that male folate status was unresponsive to supplementation.', 'Others have not reported this effect (Mierzecki et al., 2013; Winkels et al., 2008).', 'And finally, we did not control nor monitor participant dietary habits either before or during the study.', 'As such, the potentially confounding effects of dietary habits, particularly with regard to micronutrient intake, could not be addressed.', 'In conclusion, we have demonstrated that an MVM supplement improves numerous indices of nutrition status and cardiovascular health in a young, healthy population.', 'As such, this study supports the view that dietary supplements can play an important role in meeting the nutritional requirements of individuals, and in so doing may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with micronutrient deficiencies, particularly among individuals with hidden-hungers who may otherwise be unaware of sub-optimal nutrition status.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author_highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"important_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 200,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 381,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          381,\n          -1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"BERTopic_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
